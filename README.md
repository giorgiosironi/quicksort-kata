## What is this?

An example of implementing the Quicksort algorithm over an integer array given as input.

Instead of looking for examples, random lists of up to 50 elements are generated by [Eris](http://github.com/giorgiosironi/eris), containing the numbers from -100 to 100.

In case of failures, the input is minimized until the smallest list that causes an assertion failure is found. For example, an implementation bug dropping repeated elements gave the list [-33, -33] as the problematic test case instead of a list of dozens of elements.

By defining just two properties (sorting order and length preservation) that must be valid over all outputs, we already gain more confidence in an algorithm's implementation than by adding dozens of examples by hand.

## Expansions

* What are other possible properties to verify over the output of Quicksort?
* How can we share the domain passed to `forAll()` between multiple tests without losing readability?
